# project_lifestyle
## Introduction
This project was developed using a dataset available in https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ydalat/lifestyle-and-wellbeing-data?resource=download. The survey used to gather this data can be found in http://www.authentic-happiness.com/your-life-satisfaction-score and includes 24 attributes describing how we live our lives, including a calculated field, the WorkLifeBalance_Score. After exploring the data, it was built two different machine learning models in order to predict the body mass index from the lifestyle of the respondents.
